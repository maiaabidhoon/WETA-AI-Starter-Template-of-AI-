# 🚀 AI From Scratch

A custom **AI system built completely from scratch**, without using pre-trained models.
This project is an experimental step towards understanding the fundamentals of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks** at a low level.

---

## 📌 Features

* ✅ Implemented core AI logic without pre-trained libraries.
* ✅ Custom training loop and learning algorithm.
* ✅ Lightweight and educational – made for learning AI internals.
* ✅ Open-source and extendable.
